# BTL1 Machine Learning (CO3117) - Machine Learning (ML) with text Data
## *Overview and goal of this excercise*

Through all BTL (1, 2 and 3), these excercises aim to apply machine learning knowledge to various data types, utilizing the traditional machine learning pipeline and the modern machine learning pipeline.

## **Project structure**
The project has 3 folders: BTL1, BTL2, BTL3, each utilizes ML on a tasks

Each folder includes:
+ A google collab file in ```./notebook``` folder containing all the code. 
+ A ```./plots``` folder containing all the images
+ A ```./modules``` folder containing all modules
+ A ```./features``` folder containing all trained features (if any) of the models used in that task 
+ A README file specifically for that task

## *Setup and run*

Clone the project:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Thien-lee-44/BTL_ML251.git
cd BTL_ML251/BTLx
```

where x is 1, 2 or 3

Then run the collab file located in ```./notebook```, the collab file is set up to be able to run all from the start

## *Datasets used* 

### BTL1:

dataset chosen is over 10k entries of various car models' features, used to predict car prices.

The dataset is publicly available at [this kaggle link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/CooperUnion/cardataset/data).

### BTL2:

dataset chosen is over 10k poems obtained from Poetry Foundation website. Evenly split between 5 catgories:

+ Tự nhiên
+ Mĩ thuật và Khoa học
+ Tình cảm
+ Các mối quan hệ
+ Tôn giáo

The dataset is publicly available at [this kaggle link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/djdonpablo/poem-classification-dataset).
